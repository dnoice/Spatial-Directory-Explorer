# Spatial-Directory-Explorer
A modern, spatial-based file explorer that visualizes your directory structure as a zoomable space rather than a traditional tree view. The application uses hardware-accelerated animations, efficient data management, and virtualized rendering for smooth performance even with large directory structures.
